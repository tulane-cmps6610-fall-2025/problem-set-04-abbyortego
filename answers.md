There seems to be a somewhat consistent trend. The Huffman coding cost continues to be close to 3/4 of the cost of a Fixed-Length coding.  

- **1e.**
When Huffman coding is applied to an alphabet where each character has equal frequency the results should be similar to that of a Fixed-Length coding. Since there is no one character with a higher frequency than the others, the number of bits used to represent them will be the same for all and will be determined with the same formula that Fixed-Length coding uses ($\log_2(k)$ where $k$ is the number of characters in the alphabet) for any document.
